# Lacanian Discourse Combinator
This is a tool for exploring various discourses that can be produced by extending [Jacques Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan)'s theory of [the Four Discourses](https://nosubject.com/Four_Discourses).
## Usage
Input a discourse with four mathemes into the input box. If a discourse has a predefined name, it will get displayed (by default the original four discourses are defined). Clear button clears the form.
### Inner Ring
Inputting a discourse produces the three other rotations of that discourse 
in the inner circle, forming a complete ring (e.g. Inputting any of the original four discourses will produce the other three, forming the ring of the four discourses).
### Outer Ring
The input gets modified by an operation to derive the topmost discourse, and the three other rotations of that discourse are displayed on the outer cicle, forming another complete ring. \
The operation is defined in such a way that it produces the Capitalist's Discourse from the Master's Discourse (viz. switching the places of *Agent* and *Truth*).
### Custom discourses
Here one can add custom discourses to be displayed or remove existing discourses. Duplicates are not allowed.
